Excellent work on your presentation (despite the ominous overtones and depressing nature of your topic).  While 
you didn't leave us with very optimistic view of the work done to date, you did give provide a very clear review
of the material.  Of course the awesome PyMOL movie and car gif helped.  

Score: 10/10
